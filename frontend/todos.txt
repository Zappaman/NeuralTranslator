high priority:
    - minimal styling -> semantic ui
    - find out how to directly download file:
        -> issue translate
        -> check translate status
        -> update on client that the download is available
            -> classic: client requests file translation update -> is it ready or not?

    - user registration -> user registers and creates an account on your service and will have access to only a snapshot of the data translated


nice to haves:
    - also implement general translation for text documents, pdfs?
    - translation bar
    - faster translation option
    - client side translation
